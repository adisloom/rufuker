###### A userscript for a browser. 
#### Culturally enriches the pidorussian lingamus on the popular chat platform with funny pictures for girls 2ch. The site becomes even more funnier.


Requirements
* Browser: Chrome or Firefox or Vivaldi
* A browser plugin: Tampermonkey or ViolentMonkey
* Setting: Set "Run only in top frame" to "No" in plugin's settings for the script.

Otherwise you can simply paste it into a browser console when the site page is opened. It may also work in other usercript manager plugins like GreaseMonkey _except for FireMonkey due to incompatibility_.
